If you didn't like the *Bayonetta* games, then you're...entirely valid in your opinion. It was definitely problematic in its presentation and either you found its eventual resolution and utilization of those very pointed, deliberate decisions enjoyable or further atrocious.

And that's a shame because they have some of the best action gameplay and mechanics of any game out there. It's a swirling, psychedelic, overwhelming trip down a hole of giant demons and hair punches and kicks. If you never gave them a shot, then good news because Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime revealed at The Game Awards this year that both *Bayonetta* games will be coming to the Nintendo Switch on February 16, 2018.

But wait! Fils-Aime has One More Thing.

Yeah, that's a Jobsian announcement for *Bayonetta 3*, exclusive for the Nintendo Switch. No release date, but the game's mere existence is probably enough for fans until we find out more.
