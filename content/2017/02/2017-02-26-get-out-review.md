*Get Out* is a rare, beautiful, frightening film. It has depth beyond depth. Where many other movies would have been satisfied even having two layers while being perfectly effective in its genre, writer and director Jordan Peele wanted to go [further](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/movies/jordan-peele-interview-get-out.html), and it went to a place I just can't stop thinking about.

On its surface, it addresses the same sort of race relation drama we've seen before in movies like *[Hidden Figures](http://www.platformnation.com/2017/01/25/you-should-probably-watch-hidden-figures/)* and *Fences*. Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) pack up for a weekend at her parents' upstate estate. He's a bit wary of the encounter, wondering if either of them are aware he's, well, black.

This very easily could be framed as a drama, and while many other writers would have attempted it, Peele presents the entire ordeal as a horror. It is such a natural fit, it's curious more filmmakers don't give it a whirl. Sure, the interactions of a reluctant participant with aggressively, naively white family members are rife with dramatic tension, but when you inject it with influences from horror classics *The Stepford Wives* and *Rosemary's Baby*.

It's strange yet comforting that the casting works so well here. Rose's father Dean is played by Bradley Whitford while her mother Missy is played by Catherine Keener, two of the most soothing parental figures of the movie industry. But when you frame them as a neurosurgeon and a hypnotherapist (two revered but little-understood careers in fucking with brains), their slow and methodical characterizations become eerie and disturbing.

The mystery then begins to unfurl before you as Chris' reluctance turns to malaise. The Armitage estate is solely managed by black servants, none of whom seem to behave like real people should. Are they hiding something or are they the something being hidden? One night, to ease his mind and indulge in his addiction, Chris steps out for a smoke only to end up having, well, a strange and unsettling encounter with pretty much everyone.

The gradual reveal of the psychological terror at play is expertly done here. It does that thing that all good brain-shattering horror films do: it points out each pillar that upholds your sanity and comfort just before it purposefully and menacingly knocks each one down. The final turn is especially great since it gives the entire cast, primary and supporting, to fully flex their muscles, which includes a personal crush-defining scene with Williams at the kitchen table.

Ending it there, however, would be a great disservice. The dissection of modern racism is done perhaps even better than the horror elements, which Peele handles with both reverence and a wink. While you can easily see the superficial components (i.e., white people don't understand what it feels like to be non-white especially with respect to [social isolation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/movies/jordan-peele-narrates-a-scene-from-get-out.html)), it quickly uses this as a launching pad for far more complex and nuanced facets.

The simplest exploration is the idea that someone could own you. Your decisions are your own, but the opportunities afforded to you are limited by actions not your own. This is shown upfront by the two hands working the estate Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) with the implied terror that they are owned yet not outright slaves.

With the introduction of Missy and Dean and their respective professions, however, that quickly transforms into a vastly different but related fear of your consciousness [not being yours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_consciousness). It's a representation of the fear many minorities experience that is often laughed off as being called an Oreo or a Twinkie. It can kindly be considered acclimating to another culture, but it really is letting a completely different philosophy inhabit your mind and body as your own individuality is suppressed.

The greatest fear it plays on, however, is something that maybe only academics of the field or minorities (not even racial but also whatever creed or identity you embody) that have experienced marginalization will recognize. It poses the question of when does playing along to get along go too far. When does smiling along with the awkward proclamation that Jesse Owens and Barack Obama are *the best* or the misappropriation of "urban speak" slang become more hurtful than helpful? When do you speak up and when do you shut up?

It's a question of what battles are worth fighting, and it's an uncertainty and paranoia that marginalized people all over the world deal with on a daily basis. It's something that an overwhelming majority of the world will see presented in literal and terrifying terms. Chances are you are not a heterosexual, cisgender white man, which means chances are you have been stepped on and over at some point in your life.

There's a lot more I'd like to say about *Get Out*, but it'd all probably be better left to those that dedicate their lives to studying and understanding and living and fixing the horrors depicted here. Well, I mean, the horrors beyond the *Stepford* bits, but I guess that is also a distinct possibility in the near future. So, enjoy your time living a life where racism is the only problem you have and robots have yet to take over or something? Just go see *Get Out* already.
