Have y'all seen *Birds of Prey* yet? We've got [a review](https://workingmirror.com/2020/02/07/birds-of-prey-review/) up, so you should go read that. But I personally have not stopped thinking about it since I walked out of that theatre. It's such an indulgent thing that you'd think it wouldn't work, but it does.

Margot Robbie's performance, as all of hers are, is superb, but something she does that not a lot of traditionally non-action actors do is emote during stunt sequences. And more than that, she exhibits emotions other than just Trying Hard and Very Angry, which is crucial to the Harley character. She's a murder, a psychopath, and just generally a bad person; she's clearly going to get some joy out of whacking people in the head with a mallet.

Anyway, after you're done watching all these trailers, I recommend making plans to go see *Birds of Prey*. You'll be in for a good time.

### *The Jesus Rolls* - Official Trailer

{% youtube rLAmpku4fyg %}

Now this is a trailer. Way better than the teaser, which was objectively bad. It showcases the Jesus as a demented man who freely engages in criminal activity, which is the kind of weird interpretation of the character we need. And look at that cast! This is shaping up to be quite the ride.

It hits theatres on March 6, 2020.

### *Murder by Numbers* - Special Animated Intro

{% youtube mZ0aLdpcPHk %}

Announced back in October 2019, this has been a weird little game that has caught the attention of a lot of folk. But what can you expect when the elevator pitch is *Ace Attorney* meets *Picross*, two of the most intimately beloved series of the entire industry. You won't hear people talk about them that often, but that's because every just agrees: they're good.

So seeing this bonkers and wholesome animated intro come out is just reinforcing the idea that this is going to be up a lot of alleys.

Look for it on the Switch and PC early this year.

### *Spiral: From The Book of Saw* - Teaser Trailer

{% youtube rgNlWypWmtw %}

It's kind of remarkable how many shots some directors get. Darren Lynn Bousman got into the *Saw* franchise with *Saw II*, proceeded to help drive that into the ground, and then made a bunch of other pretty bland horror films until a few years ago when he was part of the *Tales of Halloween* anthology and adapted his own short film into *Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival*, both kind of redeeming him.

But now, this movie is pairing him with the writer *Good Luck Chuck*, the same guy who directed *The Hungover Games*. So you'll have to excuse me if I'm pretty indifferent about this thing.

It's coming to theatres on May 15, 2020.

### *Fallout 76: Wastelanders* - Official Trailer

{% youtube BO7ZEvizL2Y %}

I never got into [*Fallout 76*](https://workingmirror.com/2018/06/11/lets-talk-about-fallout-76/); it kind of took all the things I liked about [*Fallout 4*](https://workingmirror.com/2016/09/01/fallout-4-nuka-world-review/) and replaced them with people, which I'm not much a fan of. But this bit of free content looks interesting. Putting you smack-dab in the middle of two warring factions is just good MMO content. Plus, look at that nutso bipedal monster. I, too, would like to shoot it with an arrow.

This expansion comes to *Fallout 76* on April 7, 2020.

### *Altered Carbon* - Season 2 Teaser

{% youtube BpbtLSJEHJQ %}

I like the idea of *Altered Carbon* from the production side. (The first season was also [pretty good](https://workingmirror.com/2018/02/06/altered-carbon-review/) from the perspective of the audience, too.) Each season you carry on the same setting and (mostly) the same characters, but within the conceit of swapping bodies, you get new people like the terrific Anthony Mackie to play the leads. And you get new showrunners like Alison Schapker who wrote some of the better episodes of *The Flash* and *Fringe*.

All the episodes land on Netflix on February 27, 2020.

### *Skater XL* - Update

{% youtube dBSFTv0Bl1k %}

When this first hit Early Access, no one had much to say. That's because there was much to talk about. It was as barebones of an Early Access game as there has been; outside of smashing your face against the ground as you bail on the few tricks it could register, there wasn't much to do. But this update trailer makes it look like they've been pretty busy stuffing it with more, well, stuff.

Anyway, you can get it on PC now and at some point "soon" on Xbox One and Switch.

### *Radioactive* - Main Trailer

{% youtube YT5g0U2WvQ0 %}

Hell yeah Marie Curie. The first presentation I ever gave on anything in school was about her. And as much as I tend to relegate period biopics to the Oscar Bait category of things (i.e., they'll be good but rarely exceptional, often relying on the fact that the history itself is what is naturally remarkable), pairing Curie's story with director Marjane Satrapi seems like a great fit. If you've seen *Persepolis*, you'll know what I mean.

It comes to theatres on March 8, 2020.

### *Most Dangerous Game* - Teaser

{% youtube d7Lc8Eo6yTc %}

The fact that this comes out the very year that *The Most Dangerous Game* hits the public domain is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Such a fucking bullshit capitalist move. But whatever. This has Christoph Waltz, and that's enough to grab my attention.

It starts streaming on Quibi on April 6, 2020, when the Quibi streaming service launches.
